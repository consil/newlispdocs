Function: unique
------------------------------------

#### syntax: (unique *list*)

Returns a unique version of *list* with all duplicates removed.

    (unique '(2 3 4 4 6 7 8 7))  â†’ (2 3 4 6 7 8)

Note that the list does not need to be sorted, but a sorted list makes
`unique` perform faster.

Other *set* functions are [difference](#difference),
[intersect](#intersect) and [union](#union).
