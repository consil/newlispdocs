Function: sub
---------------------------------

#### syntax: (sub *num-1* [*num-2* ... ])

Successively subtracts the expressions in *num-1*, *num-2*—. `sub`
performs mixed-type arithmetic and handles integers or floating points,
but it will always return a floating point number. If only one argument
is supplied, its sign is reversed. Any floating point calculation with
`NaN` also returns `NaN`.

    (sub 10 8 0.25)  → 1.75
    (sub 123)        → -123
