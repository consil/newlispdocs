Function: write-file
----------------------------------------

#### syntax: (write-file *str-file-name* *str-buffer*)

Writes a file in *str-file-name* with contents in *str-buffer* in one
swoop and returns the number of bytes written.

On failure the function returns `nil`. For error information, use
[sys-error](#sys-error) when used on files. When used on URLs
[net-error](#net-error) gives more error information.

    (write-file "myfile.enc"
        (encrypt (read-file "/home/lisp/myFile") "secret"))

The file `myfile` is read, [encrypted](#encrypt) using the password
`secret`, and written back into the new file `myfile.enc` in the current
directory.

`write-file` can take an `http://` or `file://` URL in *str-file-name*.
When the prefix `http://` is used, `write-file` works exactly like
[put-url](#put-url) and can take the same additional parameters:

    (write-file "http://asite.com/message.txt" "This is a message" )

The file `message.txt` is created and written at a remote location,
`http://asite.com`, with the contents of *str-buffer*. In this mode,
`write-file` can also be used to transfer files to remote newLISP server
nodes.

See also the [append-file](#append-file) and [read-file](#read-file)
functions.
