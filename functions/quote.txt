Function: quote
-----------------------------------

#### syntax: (quote *exp*)

Returns *exp* without evaluating it. The same effect can be obtained by
prepending a `'` (single quote) to *exp*. The function `quote` is
resolved during runtime, the prepended `'` quote is translated into a
protective envelope (quote cell) during code translation.

    (quote x)         → x
    (quote 123)       → 123
    (quote (a b c))   → (a b c)
    (= (quote x) 'x)  → true
