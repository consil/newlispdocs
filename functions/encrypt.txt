Function: encrypt
-------------------------------------

#### syntax: (encrypt *str-source* *str-pad*)

Performs a [one-time pad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad)
(OTP) encryption of *str-source* using the encryption pad in *str-pad*.
The longer *str-pad* is and the more random the bytes are, the safer the
encryption. If the pad is as long as the source text, is fully random,
and is used only once, then one-time–pad encryption is virtually
impossible to break, since the encryption seems to contain only random
data. To retrieve the original, the same function and pad are applied
again to the encrypted text:

    (set 'secret 
      (encrypt "A secret message" "my secret key")) 
    → ",YS\022\006\017\023\017TM\014\022\n\012\030E"

    (encrypt secret "my secret key")  → "A secret message"

The second example encrypts a whole file:

    (write-file "myfile.enc" 
      (encrypt (read-file "myfile") "29kH67*"))
