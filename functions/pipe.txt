Function: pipe
----------------------------------

#### syntax: (pipe)

Creates an inter-process communications pipe and returns the `read` and
`write` handles to it within a list.

    (pipe)  â†’ (3 4)  ; 3 for read, 4 for writing

The pipe handles can be passed to a child process launched via
[process](#process) or to [fork](#fork) for inter-process
communications.

Note that the pipe does not block when being written to, but it does
block reading until bytes are available. A [read-line](#read-line)
blocks until a newline character is received. A [read](#read) blocks
when fewer characters than specified are available from a pipe that has
not had the writing end closed by all processes.

More than one pipe can be opened if required.

newLISP can also use *named pipes*. See the [open](#open) function for
further information.
