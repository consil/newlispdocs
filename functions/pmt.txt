Function: pmt
---------------------------------

**syntax: (pmt *num-interest* *num-periods* *num-principal*
[*num-future-value* [*int-type*]])**

Calculates the payment for a loan based on a constant interest of
*num-interest* and constant payments over *num-periods* of time.
*num-future-value* is the value of the loan at the end (typically
`0.0`). If payment is at the end of the period, *int-type* is `0` (zero)
or *int-type* is omitted; for payment at the beginning of each period,
*int-type* is 1.

    (pmt (div 0.07 12) 240 100000)  â†’ -775.2989356

The above example calculates a payment of \$775.30 for a loan of
\$100,000 at a yearly interest rate of 7 percent. It is calculated
monthly and paid over 20 years (20 \* 12 = 240 monthly periods). This
illustrates the typical way payment is calculated for mortgages.
