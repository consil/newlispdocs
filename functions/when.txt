Function: when
----------------------------------

#### syntax: (when *exp-condition* *body*)

The statements in *body* are only evaluated if *exp-condition* evaluates
to anything not `nil` and not the empty list `()`. The result of the
last expression in *body* is returned or `nil` or the empty list `()` if
*body* was not executed.

Because `when` does not have an *else* condition as in [if](#if), the
statements in *body* need not to be grouped with [begin](#begin):

    (when (read-line)
        (set 'result (analyze (current-line)))
        (report result)
        (finish)
    )   

See also the function [unless](#unless) working like
`(when (not ...) ...)`.
