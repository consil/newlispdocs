Function: quote?
------------------------------------

#### syntax: (quote? *exp*)

Evaluates and tests whether *exp* is quoted. Returns `true` or `nil`
depending on the result.

    (set 'var ''x)  → 'x
    (quote? var)    → true

Note that in the `set` statement, ` ''x` is quoted twice because the
first quote is lost during the evaluation of the `set` assignment.
