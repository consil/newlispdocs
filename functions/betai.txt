Function: betai
-----------------------------------

#### syntax: (betai *num-x* *num-a* *num-b*)

The *Incomplete Beta* function, `betai`, equals the cumulative
probability of the *Beta* distribution, `betai`, at *x* in *num-x*. The
cumulative binomial distribution is defined as the probability of an
event, *pev*, with probability *p* to occur *k* or more times in *N*
trials:

***pev = Betai(p, k, N - k + 1)***

    (betai 0.5 3 8)  â†’ 0.9453125

The example calculates the probability for an event with a probability
of 0.5 to occur 3 or more times in 10 trials (8 = 10 - 3 + 1). The
incomplete Beta distribution can be used to derive a variety of other
functions in mathematics and statistics. See also the
[binomial](#binomial) function.
