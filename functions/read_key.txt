Function: read-key
--------------------------------------

#### syntax: (read-key)

Reads a key from the keyboard and returns an integer value. For
navigation keys, more than one `read-key` call must be made. For keys
representing ASCII characters, the return value is the same on all OSes,
except for navigation keys and other control sequences like function
keys, in which case the return values may vary on different OSes and
configurations.

    (read-key)  → 97  ; after hitting the A key
    (read-key)  → 65  ; after hitting the shifted A key
    (read-key)  → 10  ; after hitting [enter] on Linux
    (read-key)  → 13  ; after hitting [enter] on Win32

    (while (!= (set 'c (read-key)) 1) (println c))

The last example can be used to check return sequences from navigation
and function keys. To break out of the loop, press `Ctrl-A`.

Note that `read-key` will only work when newLISP is running in a Unix
shell or Win32 command shell. It will not work in the Java based
newLISP-GS or Tcl/Tk based newLISP-Tk frontend. It will also not work
when executed by newLISP Unix shared library or newLISP Win32 DLL
(Dynamic Link Library).
