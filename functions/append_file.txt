Function: append-file
-----------------------------------------

#### syntax: (append-file *str-filename* *str-buffer*)

Works similarly to [write-file](#write-file), but the content in
*str-buffer* is appended if the file in *str-filename* exists. If the
file does not exist, it is created (in this case, `append-file` works
identically to [write-file](#write-file)). This function returns the
number of bytes written.

On failure the function returns `nil`. For error information, use
[sys-error](#sys-error) when used on files. When used on URLs
[net-error](#net-error) gives more error information.

    (write-file "myfile.txt" "ABC") 
    (append-file "myfile.txt" "DEF")

    (read-file "myfile.txt")  â†’ "ABCDEF"

`append-file` can take a `http://` or `file://` URL in *str-file-name*.
In case of the `http://` prefix , `append-file` works exactly like
[put-url](#put-url) with `"Pragma: append\r\n"` in the header option and
can take the same additional parameters. The `"Pragma: append\r\n"`
option is supplied automatically.

    (append-file "http://asite.com/message.txt" "More message text.")

The file `message.txt` is appended at a remote location
`http://asite.com` with the contents of *str-buffer*. If the file does
not yet exist, it will be created. In this mode, `append-file` can also
be used to transfer files to remote newLISP server nodes.

See also [read-file](#read-file) and [write-file](#write-file).
