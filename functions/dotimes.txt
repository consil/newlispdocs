Function: dotimes
-------------------------------------

#### syntax: (dotimes (*sym-var* *int-count* [*exp-break*]) *body*)

The expressions in *body* are evaluated *int* times. The variable in
*sym* is set from 0 (zero) to (*int* - 1) each time before evaluating
the body expression(s). The variable used as the loop index is local to
the `dotimes` expression and behaves according the rules of dynamic
scoping. The loop index is of integer type. `dotimes` returns the result
of the last expression evaluated in *body*. After evaluation of the
`dotimes` statement *sym* assumes its previous value.

Optionally, a condition for early loop exit may be defined in
*exp-break*. If the break expression evaluates to any non-`nil` value,
the `dotimes` loop returns with the value of *exp-break*. The break
condition is tested before evaluating *body*.

    (dotimes (x 10)
      (print x))  â†’ 9  ; return value

This prints `0123456789` to the console window.
