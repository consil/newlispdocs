Function: search
------------------------------------

#### syntax: (search *int-file* *str-search* [*bool-flag* [*int-options*]])

Searches a file specified by its handle in *int-file* for a string in
*str-search*. *int-file* can be obtained from a previous [open](#open)
file. After the search, the file pointer is positioned at the beginning
or the end of the searched string or at the end of the file if nothing
is found.

By default, the file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the
searched string. If *bool-flag* evaluates to `true`, then the file
pointer is positioned at the end of the searched string.

In *int-options*, the options flags can be specified to perform a PCRE
regular expression search. See the function [regex](#regex) for details.
If *int-options* is not specified a faster, plain string search is
performed. `search` returns the new file position or `nil` if nothing is
found.

When using the regular expression options flag, patterns found are
stored in the system variables `$0` to `$15`.

    (set 'file (open "init.lsp" "read"))
    (search file "define")
    (print (read-line file) "\n")
    (close file)

    (set 'file (open "program.c" "r"))
    (while (search file "#define (.*)" true 0) (println $1))
    (close file)

The file `init.lsp` is opened and searched for the string `define` and
the line in which the string occurs is printed.

The second example looks for all lines in the file `program.c` which
start with the string `#define` and prints the rest of the line after
the string "\#define ".
