Function: gcd
-----------------------------------------------------

#### syntax: (gcd *int-1* [*int-2* ... ])

Calculates the greatest common divisor of a group of integers. The
greatest common divisor of two integers that are not both zero is the
largest integer that divides both numbers. `gcd` will calculate the
greatest common divisor for the first two integers in *int-i* and then
further reduce the argument list by calculating the greatest common
divisor of the result and the next argument in the parameter list.

    (gcd 0)        → 0
    (gcd 0 0)      → 0
    (gcd 10)       → 10
    (gcd 12 36)    → 12
    (gcd 15 36 6)  → 3
