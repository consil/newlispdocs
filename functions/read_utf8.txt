Function: read-utf8
---------------------------------------

#### syntax: (read-utf8 *int-file*)

Reads an UTF-8 character from a file specified by the file handle in
*int-file*. The file handle is obtained from a previous [open](#open)
operation. Each `read-utf8` advances the file pointer by the number of
bytes contained in the UTF-8 character. Once the end of the file is
reached, `nil` is returned.

The function returns an integer value which can be converted to a
displayable UTF-8 character string using the [char](#char) function.

    (set 'fle (open "utf8text.txt" "read"))
    (while (setq chr (read-utf8 fle))
        (print (char chr)))

The example reads a file containing UTF-8 encoded text and displays it
to the terminal screen.
