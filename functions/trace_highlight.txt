Function: trace-highlight
---------------------------------------------

#### syntax: (trace-highlight *str-pre* *str-post* [*str-header* *str-footer*])

Sets the characters or string of characters used to enclose expressions
during [trace](#trace). By default, the \# (number sign) is used to
enclose the expression highlighted in [trace](#trace) mode. This can be
changed to different characters or strings of up to seven characters. If
the console window accepts terminal control characters, this can be used
to display the expression in a different color, bold, reverse, and so
forth.

Two more strings can optionally be specified for *str-header and
str-footer*, which control the separator and prompt. A maximum of 15
characters is allowed for the header and 31 for the footer.

    ;; active expressions are enclosed in >> and <<

    (trace-highlight ">>" "<<") 
                 
    ;; 'bright' color on a VT100 or similar terminal window

    (trace-highlight "\027[1m" "\027[0m")   

The first example replaces the default `#` (number sign) with a `>>` and
`<<`. The second example works on most Linux shells. It may not,
however, work in console windows under Win32 or CYGWIN, depending on the
configuration of the terminal.
