Function: irr
---------------------------------

#### syntax: (irr *list-amounts* [*list-times* [*num-guess*]])

Calculates the internal rate of return of a cash flow per time period.
The internal rate of return is the interest rate that makes the present
value of a cash flow equal to `0.0` (zero). In-flowing (negative values)
and out-flowing (positive values) amounts are specified in
*list-amounts*. If no time periods are specified in *list-times*,
amounts in *list-amounts* correspond to consecutive time periods
increasing by 1 (1, 2, 3—). The algorithm used is iterative, with an
initial guess of 0.5 (50 percent). Optionally, a different initial guess
can be specified. The algorithm returns when a precision of 0.000001
(0.0001 percent) is reached. `nil` is returned if the algorithm cannot
converge after 50 iterations.

*irr* is often used to decide between different types of investments.

    (irr '(-1000 500 400 300 200 100))  
    → 0.2027

    (npv 0.2027 '(500 400 300 200 100)) 
    → 1000.033848 ; ~ 1000

    (irr '(-1000 500 400 300 200 100) '(0 3 4 5 6 7)) 
    → 0.0998

    (irr '(-5000 -2000 5000 6000) '(0 3 12 18)) 
    → 0.0321

If an initial investment of 1,000 yields 500 after the first year, 400
after two years, and so on, finally reaching `0.0` (zero) after five
years, then that corresponds to a yearly return of about 20.2 percent.
The next line demonstrates the relation between `irr` and [npv](#npv).
Only 9.9 percent returns are necessary when making the first withdrawal
after three years.

In the last example, securities were initially purchased for 5,000, then
for another 2,000 three months later. After a year, securities for 5,000
are sold. Selling the remaining securities after 18 months renders
6,000. The internal rate of return is 3.2 percent per month, or about 57
percent in 18 months.
