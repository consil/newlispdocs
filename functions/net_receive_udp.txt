Function: net-receive-udp
---------------------------------------------

#### syntax: (net-receive-udp *int-port* *int-maxsize* [*int-microsec* [*str-addr-if*]])

Receives a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packet on port *int-port*,
reading *int-maxsize* bytes. If more than *int-maxsize* bytes are
received, bytes over *int-maxsize* are discarded on Linux/BSD; on Win32,
`net-receive-udp` returns `nil`. `net-receive-udp` blocks until a
datagram arrives or the optional timeout value in *int-microsec*
expires. When setting up communications between datagram sender and
receiver, the `net-receive-udp` statement must be set up first.

No previous setup using `net-listen` or `net-connect` is necessary.

`net-receive-udp` returns a list containing a string of the UDP packet
followed by a string containing the sender's IP number and the port
used.

    ;; wait for datagram with maximum 20 bytes 
    (net-receive-udp 10001 20) 

    ;; or
    (net-receive-udp 10001 20 5000000)  ; wait for max 5 seconds
              
    ;; executed on remote computer
    (net-send-udp "nuevatec.com" 1001 "Hello")  → 4 

    ;; returned from the net-receive-udp statement
    → ("Hello" "128.121.96.1" 3312)  

    ;; sending binary information
    (net-send-udp "ahost.com" 2222 (pack "c c c c" 0 1 2 3))  
    → 4 

    ;; extracting the received info
    (set 'buff (first (net-receive-udp 2222 10)))   

    (print (unpack "c c c c" buff))  → (0 1 2 3)

See also the [net-send-udp](#net-send-udp) function for sending
datagrams and the [pack](#pack) and [unpack](#unpack) functions for
packing and unpacking binary information.

To listen on a specified address on computers with more than one
interface card, an interface IP address or name can be optionally
specified in *str-addr-if*. When specifying *str-addr-if*, a timeout
must also be specified in *int-wait*.

As an alternative, UDP communication can be set up using
[net-listen](#net-listen), or [net-connect](#net-connect) together with
the `"udp"` option to make non-blocking data exchange possible with
[net-receive-from](#net-receive-from) and [net-send-to](#net-send-to).
