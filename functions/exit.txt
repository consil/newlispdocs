Function: exit
----------------------------------

#### syntax: (exit [*int*])

Exits newLISP. An optional exit code, *int*, may be supplied. This code
can be tested by the host operating system. When newLISP is run in
[daemon server mode](#daemon) using `-d` as a command-line option, only
the network connection is closed, while newLISP stays resident,
listening for a new connection.

    (exit 5)
