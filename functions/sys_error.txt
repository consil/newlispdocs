Function: sys-error
---------------------------------------

#### syntax: (sys-error)\
 syntax: (sys-error *int-error*)\
 syntax: (sys-error `0`)

Reports the last error generated by the underlying OS which newLISP is
running on. The error reported may differ on the platforms newLISP has
been compiled for. Consult the platform's C library information. The
error is reported as a list of error number and error text.

If no error has occurred or the system error number has been reset,
`nil` is returned.

When *int-error* is greater `0` (zero) a list of the number and the
error text is returned.

To reset the error specify `0` as the error number.

Whenever a function in newLISP within the system resources area returns
`nil`, `sys-error` can be checked for the underlying reason. For file
operations, `sys-error` may be set for nonexistent files or wrong
permissions when accessing the resource. Another cause of error could be
the exhaustion of certain system resources like file handles or
semaphores.

    ;; trying to open a nonexistent file
    (open "xyz" "r")  → nil

    (sys-error)       → (2 "No such file or directory")

    ;; reset errno
    (sys-error 0)     → (0 "Unknown error: 0")
    (sys-error)       → nil
