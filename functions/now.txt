Function: now
---------------------------------

#### syntax: (now [*int-minutes-offset* [*int-index*]])

Returns information about the current date and time as a list of
integers. An optional time-zone offset can be specified in minutes in
*int-minutes-offset*. This causes the time to be shifted forward or
backward in time, before being split into separate date values.

An optional list-index in *int-index* makes `now` return a specific
member in the result list.

    (now)       → (2002 2 27 18 21 30 140000 57 3 -300 0)
    (now 0 -2)  → -300 ; minutes west of GMT


    (apply date-value (now))  → 1014834090

The numbers represent the following date-time fields:

  format                        description
  ----------------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  year                          Gregorian calendar
  month                         (1–12)
  day                           (1–31)
  hour                          (0–23) UTC
  minute                        (0–59)
  second                        (0–59)
  microsecond                   (0–999999) OS-specific, millisecond resolution
  day of current year           Jan 1st is 1
  day of current week           (1–7) starting Monday
  time zone offset in minutes   west of GMT
  daylight savings time type    (0–6) on Linux/Unix or bias in minutes on Win32


The second example returns the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time
value of seconds after January 1, 1970.

Ranging from 0 to 23, hours are given in UTC and are not adjusted for
the local time zone. The resolution of the `microseconds` field depends
on the operating system and platform. On some platforms, the last three
digits of the `microseconds` field are always `0` (zero).

The "day of the week" field starts with 1 on Monday conforming to the
ISO 8601 international standard for date and time representation.

On some platforms, the daylight savings time flag is not active and
returns `0` (zero) even during daylight savings time (dst).

Depending on the geographical area, the daylight savings time type (dst)
has a different value from 1 to 6:

  type   area
  ------ ----------------------
  0      not on dst
  1      USA style dst
  2      Australian style dst
  3      Western European dst
  4      Middle European dst
  5      Eastern European dst
  6      Canada dst
