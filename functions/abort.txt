Function: abort
-----------------------------------

#### syntax: (abort *int-pid*)\
 syntax: (abort)

In the first form, `abort` aborts a specific child process of the
current parent process giving the process id in *int-pid*. The process
must have been started using [spawn](#spawn). For processes started
using [fork](#fork), use [destroy](#destroy) instead.

The function `abort` is not available on Win32.

    (abort 2245)  → true

To abort all child processes spawned from the current process use
`abort` without any parameters:

    (abort)  → true ; abort all

The function `abort` is part of the Cilk API for synchronizing child
processes and process parallelization. See the reference for the
function [spawn](#spawn) for a full discussion of the Cilk API.
