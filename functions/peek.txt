Function: peek
----------------------------------

#### syntax: (peek *int-handle*)

Returns the number of bytes ready to be read on a file descriptor;
otherwise, it returns `nil` if the file descriptor is invalid. `peek`
can also be used to check `stdin`. This function is only available on
Unix-like operating systems.

    (peek 0)  ; check # of bytes ready on stdin

Use the [net-peek](#net-peek) function to check for network sockets, or
for the number of available bytes on them. On Unix systems,
[net-peek](#net-peek) can be used to check file descriptors. The
difference is that [net-peek](#net-peek) also sets
[net-error](#net-error).
