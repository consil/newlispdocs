Function: destroy
-------------------------------------

#### syntax: (destroy *int-pid*)\
 syntax: (destroy *int-pid* *int-signal*)

Destroys a process with process id in *int-pid* and returns `true` on
success or `nil` on failure. The process id is normally obtained from a
previous call to [fork](#fork) on Mac OS X and other Unix or
[process](#process) on all platforms. On Unix, `destroy` works like the
system utility *kill* using the SIGKILL signal.

CAUTION! If *int-pid* is `0` the signal is sent to all processes whose
group ID is equal to the process group ID of the sender. If *int-pid* is
`-1` all processes with the current user id will be killed, if newLISP
is started with super user privileges, all processes except system
processes are destroyed.

When specifying *int-signal*, `destroy` works like a Unix `kill` command
sending the specified Unix signal to the process in *int-pid*. This
second syntax is not available on Win32.

    (set 'pid (process "/usr/bin/bc" bcin bcout)) 
    (destroy pid)

    (set 'pid (fork (dotimes (i 1000) (println i) (sleep 10))))
    (sleep 100) (destroy pid)
