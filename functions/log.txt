Function: log
---------------------------------

#### syntax: (log *num*)\
 syntax: (log *num* *num-base*)

In the first syntax, the expression in *num* is evaluated and the
natural logarithmic function is calculated from the result.

    (log 1)         → 0
    (log (exp 1))   → 1

In the second syntax, an arbitrary base can be specified in *num-base*.

    (log 1024 2)             → 10
    (log (exp 1) (exp 1))    →  1

See also [exp](#exp), which is the inverse function to `log` with base
***e*** (2.718281828).
