Function: delete-url
----------------------------------------

#### syntax: (delete-file *str-url*)

This function deletes the file on a remote HTTP server specified in
*str-url*. The HTTP `DELETE` protocol must be enabled on the target web
server, or an error message string may be returned. The target file must
also have access permissions set accordingly. Additional parameters such
as timeout and custom headers are available exactly as in the
[get-url](#get-url) function.

If *str-url* starts with `file://` a file on the local file system is
deleted.

This feature is also available when the [delete-file](#delete-file)
function is used and a URL is specified for the filename.

    (delete-url "http://www.aserver.com/somefile.txt")
    (delete-url "http://site.org:8080/page.html" 5000)

    ; delete on the local file system
    (delete-url "file:///home/joe/somefile.txt")

The second example configures a timeout option of five seconds. Other
options such as special HTTP protocol headers can be specified, as well.
See the [get-url](#get-url) function for details.
