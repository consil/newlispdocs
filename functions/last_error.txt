Function: last-error
----------------------------------------

#### syntax: (last-error)\
 syntax: (last-error *int-error*)

Reports the last error generated by newLISP due to syntax errors or
exhaustion of some resource. For a summary of all possible errors see
the chapter [Error codes](#error_codes) in the appendix.

If no error has occurred since the newLISP session was started, `nil` is
returned.

When *int-error* is specified, a list of the number and the error text
is returned.

    (last-error)  → nil

    (abc)

    ERR: invalid function : (abc)

    (last-error) → (24 "ERR: invalid function : (abc)")

    (last-error 24) → (24 "invalid function")
    (last-error 1) → (1 "not enough memory")
    (last-error 12345) → (12345 "Unknown error")

For error numbers out of range the string `"Unknown error"` is given for
the error text.

Errors can be trapped by [error-event](#error-event) and user defined
error handlers.

See also [net-error](#net-error) for errors generated by networking
conditions and [sys-error](#sys-error) for errors generated by the
operating system.
