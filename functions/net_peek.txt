Function: net-peek
--------------------------------------

#### syntax: (net-peek *int-socket*)

Returns the number of bytes ready for reading on the network socket
*int-socket*. If an error occurs or the connection is closed, `nil` is
returned.

    (set 'aSock (net-connect "aserver.com" 123))

    (while ( = (net-peek aSock) 0) 
        (do-something-else))

    (net-receive aSock buff 1024)

After connecting, the program waits in a while loop until `aSock` can be
read.

Use the [peek](#peek) function to check file descriptors and `stdin`.
