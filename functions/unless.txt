Function: unless
------------------------------------

#### syntax: (unless *exp-condition* *body*)

The statements in *body* are only evaluated if *exp-condition* evaluates
to `nil` or the empty list `()`. The result of the last expression in
*body* is returned or `nil` or the empty list `()` if *body* was not
executed.

Because `unless` does not have an *else* condition as in [if](#if), the
statements in *body* need not to be grouped with [begin](#begin):

    (unless (starts-with (read-line) "quit")
        (process (current-line))
        ...
        (finish)
    )   

See also the function [when](#when).
