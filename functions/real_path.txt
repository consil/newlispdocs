Function: real-path
---------------------------------------

#### syntax: (real-path [*str-path*])\
 syntax: (real-path *str-exec-name* true)

In the first syntax `real-path` returns the full path from the relative
file path given in *str-path*. If a path is not given, `"."` (the
current directory) is assumed.

    (real-path)  → "/usr/home/fred"  ; current directory
    (real-path "./somefile.txt")
    → "/usr/home/fred/somefile.txt"

In the second syntax `real-path` returns the full path for an executable
found given in *str-exe-name*. This syntax relies on an environment
variable PATH defined on UNIX and Windows systems.

    (real-path "make" true) → "/usr/bin/make"

The output length is limited by the OS's maximum allowed path length. If
`real-path` fails (e.g., because of a nonexistent path), `nil` is
returned.
