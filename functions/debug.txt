Function: debug
-----------------------------------

#### syntax: (debug *func*)

Calls [trace](#trace) and begins evaluating the user-defined function in
*func*. `debug` is a shortcut for executing `(trace true)`, then
entering the function to be debugged.

    ;; instead of doing
    (trace true)
    (my-func a b c)
    (trace nil)

    ;; use debug as a shortcut
    (debug (my-func a b c))

When in `debug` or [trace](#trace) mode, error messages will be printed.
The function causing the exception will return either `0` or `nil` and
processing will continue. This way, variables and the current state of
the program can still be inspected while debugging.

See also the [trace](#trace) function.
