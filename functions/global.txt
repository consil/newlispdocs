Function: global
------------------------------------

#### syntax: (global *sym-1* [*sym-2* ... ])

One or more symbols in *sym-1* [*sym-2* ... ] can be made globally
accessible from contexts other than MAIN. The statement has to be
executed in the MAIN context, and only symbols belonging to MAIN can be
made global. `global` returns the last symbol made global.

    (global 'aVar 'x 'y 'z)  → z

    (define (foo x) 
    (…))

    (constant (global 'foo))

The second example shows how [constant](#constant) and `global` can be
combined into one statement, protecting and making a previous function
definition global.
