Function: difference
----------------------------------------

#### syntax: (difference *list-A* *list-B*)\
 syntax: (difference *list-A* *list-B* *bool*)

In the first syntax, `difference` returns the *set* difference between
*list-A* and *list-B*. The resulting list only has elements occurring in
*list-A*, but not in *list-B*. All elements in the resulting list are
unique, but *list-A* and *list-B* need not be unique. Elements in the
lists can be any type of Lisp expression.

    (difference '(2 5 6 0 3 5 0 2) '(1 2 3 3 2 1))  → (5 6 0)

In the second syntax, `difference` works in *list* mode. *bool*
specifies `true` or an expression not evaluating to `nil`. In the
resulting list, all elements of *list-B* are eliminated in *list-A*, but
duplicates of other elements in *list-A* are left.

    (difference '(2 5 6 0 3 5 0 2) '(1 2 3 3 2 1) true)  → (5 6 0 5 0)
