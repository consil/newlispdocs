Function: ostype
------------------------------------

#### syntax: ostype

`ostype` is a built-in system constant containing the name of the
operating system newLISP is running on.

    ostype  â†’ "Win32"

One of the following strings is returned:
`"Linux", "BSD", "OSX", "Tru64Unix", "Solaris", "SunOS", "Win32", "Cygwin", or "OS/2"`.

`ostype` can be used to write platform-independent code:

    (if 
        (= ostype "Linux") (import "libz.so")
        (= ostype "BSD") (import "libz.so")
        (= ostype "OSX") (import "libz.dylib")
        ...
        (println "cannot import libz on this platform")
    )

Use [sys-info](#sys-info) to learn more about the current flavor of
newLISP running.
