Function: get-long
--------------------------------------

#### syntax: (get-long *int-address*)

Gets a 64-bit integer from the address specified in *int-address*. This
function is handy when using `import` to import shared library
functions, a function returning an address pointer to a long integer, or
a pointer to a structure containing long integers.

    long long int * foo(void)
    {
    int * result;
    …
    *result = 123;
    return(result);
    }

    long long int foo-b(void)
    {
    int result;
    …
    result = 456;
    return(result);
    }

Consider the C function `foo` (from a shared library), which returns an
integer pointer (address of an integer).

    (import "mylib.so" "foo")
    (get-int (foo))  → 123
    (foo-b)          → 456

Note that using `get-long` with an incorrect address in *int-address* is
unsafe and could result in the system crashing or becoming unstable.
