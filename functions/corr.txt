Function: corr
----------------------------------

#### syntax: (corr *list-vector-X* *list-vector-Y*)

Calculates the *Pearson* product-moment correlation coefficient as a
measure of the linear relationship between the two variables in
*list-vector-X* and *list-vector-Y*. Both lists must be of same length.

`corr` returns a list containing the following values:

  name   description
  ------ -------------------------------------------------------
  r      Correlation coefficient
  b0     Regression coefficient offset
  b1     Regression coefficient slope
  t      t - statistic for significance testing
  df     Degrees of freedom for t
  p      Two tailed probability of t under the null hypothesis


    (set 'study-time '(90 100 130 150 180 200 220 300 350 400))
    (set 'test-errors '(25 28 20 20 15 12 13 10 8 6))

    (corr study-time test-errors) â†’ (-0.926 29.241 -0.064 -6.944 8 0.0001190)

The negative correlation of `-0.926` between study time and test errors
is highly significant with a two-tailed `p` of about `0.0001` under the
null hypothesis.

The regression coefficients `b0 = 29.241` and `b1 = -0.064` can be used
to estimate values of the Y variable (test errors) from values in X
(study time) using the equation `Y = b0 + b1 * X`.
