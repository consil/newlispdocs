Function: get-int
-------------------------------------

#### syntax: (get-int *int-address*)

Gets a 32-bit integer from the address specified in *int-address*. This
function is handy when using imported shared library functions with
`import`, a function returning an address pointer to an integer, or a
pointer to a structure containing integers.

    int * foo(void)
    {
    int * result;
    …
    *result = 123;
    return(result);
    }

    int foo-b(void)
    {
    int result;
    …
    result = 456;
    return(result);
    }

Consider the C function `foo` (from a shared library), which returns an
integer pointer (address of an integer).

    (import "mylib.so" "foo")
    (get-int (foo))  → 123
    (foo-b)          → 456

Note that using `get-int` with an incorrect address in *int-address* is
unsafe and could result in the system crashing or becoming unstable.
