Function: until
-----------------------------------

#### syntax: (until *exp-condition* [*body*])

Evaluates the condition in *exp-condition*. If the result is `nil` or
the empty list `()`, the expressions in *body* are evaluated. Evaluation
is repeated until the exp-condition results in a value other than `nil`
or the empty list. The result of the last expression evaluated in *body*
is the return value of the `until` expression. If *body* is empty, the
result of last *exp-condition* is returned. `until` works like
([while](#while) ([not](#not) â€¦)).

`until` also updates the system iterator symbol `$idx`.

    (device (open "somefile.txt" "read"))
    (set 'line-count 0)
    (until (not (read-line)) (inc line-count))
    (close (device))
    (print "the file has " line-count " lines\n")

Use the [do-until](#do-until) function to test the condition *after*
evaluation of the body expressions.
