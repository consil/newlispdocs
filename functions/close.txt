Function: close
-----------------------------------

#### syntax: (close *int-file*)

Closes the file specified by the file handle in *int-file*. The handle
would have been obtained from a previous [open](#open) operation. If
successful, `close` returns `true`; otherwise `nil` is returned.

    (close (device))  → true
    (close 7)         → true
    (close aHandle)   → true

Note that using `close` on [device](#device) automatically resets it to
0 (zero, the screen device).
