Function: println
-------------------------------------

#### syntax: (println *exp-1* [*exp-2* ... ])

Evaluates and prints *exp-1*â€” to the current I/O device, which defaults
to the console window. A line-feed is printed at the end. See the
built-in function [device](#device) for details on how to specify a
different I/O device. `println` works exactly like [print](#print) but
emits a line-feed character at the end.

See also the [write-line](#write-line) and [print](#print) functions.
