Function: mod
---------------------------------

#### syntax: (mod *num-1* *num-2* [*num-3* ... ])\
 syntax: (mod *num-1*)

Calculates the modular value of the numbers in *num-1* and *num-2*.
`mod` computes the remainder from the division of the numerator *num-i*
by the denominator *num-i + 1*. Specifically, the return value is
*numerator - n \* denominator*, where `n` is the quotient of the
numerator divided by the denominator, rounded towards zero to an
integer. The result has the same sign as the numerator and its magnitude
is less than the magnitude of the denominator.

In the second syntax `1` is assumed for *num-2* and the result is the
fractional part of *num-1*.

    (mod 10.5 3.3)   →  0.6
    (mod -10.5 3.3)  → -0.6
    (mod -10.5)      → -0.5

Use the [%](#arithmetic) (percent sign) function when working with
integers only.
