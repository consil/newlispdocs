Function: randomize
---------------------------------------

#### syntax: (randomize *list* [*bool*])

Rearranges the order of elements in *list* into a random order.

    (randomize '(a b c d e f g))  → (b a c g d e f)
    (randomize (sequence 1 5))    → (3 5 4 1 2)

`randomize` will always return a sequence different from the previous
one without the optional *bool* flag. This may require the function to
calculate several sets of reordered elements, which in turn may lead to
different processing times with different invocations of the function on
the same input list length. To allow for the output to be equal to the
input, `true` or any expression evaluating to not `nil` must be
specified in *bool*.

`randomize` uses an internal *pseudo random sequence* generator that
returns the same series of results each time newLISP is started. Use the
[seed](#seed) function to change this sequence.
