Function: current-line
------------------------------------------

#### syntax: (current-line)

Retrieves the contents of the last [read-line](#read-line) operation.
`current-line`'s contents are also implicitly used when
[write-line](#write-line) is called without a string parameter.

The following source shows the typical code pattern for creating a Unix
command-line filter:

    #!/usr/bin/newlisp
     
    (set 'inFile (open (main-args 2) "read"))
    (while (read-line inFile) 
      (if (starts-with (current-line) ";;")
        (write-line)))
    (exit)

The program is invoked:

    ./filter myfile.lsp

This displays all comment lines starting with `;;` from a file given as
a command-line argument when invoking the script `filter`.
