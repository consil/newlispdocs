Function: silent
------------------------------------

#### syntax: (silent [*exp-1* [*exp-2* ... ]])

Evaluates one or more expressions in *exp-1*â€”. `silent` is similar to
[begin](#begin), but it suppresses console output of the return value
and the following prompt. It is often used when communicating from a
remote application with newLISP (e.g., GUI front-ends or other
applications controlling newLISP), and the return value is of no
interest.

Silent mode is reset when returning to a prompt. This way, it can also
be used without arguments in a batch of expressions. When in interactive
mode, hit [enter] twice after a statement using `silent` to get the
prompt back.

    (silent (my-func))  ; same as next

    (silent) (my-func)  ; same effect as previous
