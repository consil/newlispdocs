Function: read-file
---------------------------------------

#### syntax: (read-file *str-file-name*)

Reads a file in *str-file-name* in one swoop and returns a string buffer
containing the data.

On failure the function returns `nil`. For error information, use
[sys-error](#sys-error) when used on files. When used on URLs
[net-error](#net-error) gives more error information.

    (write-file "myfile.enc" 
        (encrypt (read-file "/home/lisp/myFile") "secret"))

The file `myfile` is read, then encrypted using the password `"secret"`
before being written back into a new file titled `"myfile.enc"` in the
current directory.

`read-file` can take an `http://` or `file://` URL in *str-file-name*.
When the prefix is `http://`, `read-file` works exactly like
[get-url](#get-url) and can take the same additional parameters.

    (read-file "http://asite.com/somefile.tgz" 10000)

The file `somefile.tgz` is retrieved from the remote location
`http://asite.com`. The file transfer will time out after 10 seconds if
it is not finished. In this mode, `read-file` can also be used to
transfer files from remote newLISP server nodes.

See also the [write-file](#write-file) and [append-file](#append-file)
functions.
