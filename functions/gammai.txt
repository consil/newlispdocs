Function: gammai
------------------------------------

#### syntax: (gammai *num-a* *num-b*)

Calculates the incomplete Gamma function of values *a* and *b* in
*num-a* and *num-b*, respectively.

    (gammai 4 5)  → 0.7349740847

The incomplete Gamma function is used to derive the probability of Chi²
to exceed a given value for a degree of freedom, df, as follows:

> ***Q(Chi²|df) = Q(df/2, Chi²/2) = gammai(df/2, Chi²/2)***
