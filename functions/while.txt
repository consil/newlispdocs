Function: while
-----------------------------------

#### syntax: (while *exp-condition* *body*)

Evaluates the condition in *exp-condition*. If the result is not `nil`
or the empty list `()`, the expressions in *body* are evaluated.
Evaluation is repeated until an *exp-condition* results in `nil` or the
empty list `()`. The result of the body's last evaluated expression is
the return value of the `while` expression.

`while` also updates the system iterator symbol `$idx`.

    (device (open "somefile.txt" "read"))
    (set 'line-count 0)
    (while (read-line) (inc line-count))
    (close (device))
    (print "the file has " line-count " lines\n")

Use the [do-while](#do-while) function to evaluate the condition *after*
evaluating the body of expressions.
