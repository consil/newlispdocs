Function: seed
----------------------------------

#### syntax: (seed *int-seed*)

Seeds the internal random generator that generates numbers for
[amb](#amb), [normal](#normal), [rand](#rand), and [random](#random)
with the number specified in *int-seed*. Note that the random generator
used in newLISP is the C-library function *rand()*. All randomizing
functions in newLISP are based on this function.

Note that the maximum value for *int-seed* is limited to 16 or 32 bits,
depending on the operating system used. Internally, only the 32 least
significant bits are passed to the random seed function of the OS.

    (seed 12345)

    (seed (time-of-day))

After using `seed` with the same number, the random generator starts the
same sequence of numbers. This facilitates debugging when randomized
data are involved. Using `seed`, the same random sequences can be
generated over and over again.

The second example is useful for guaranteeing a different seed any time
the program starts.
