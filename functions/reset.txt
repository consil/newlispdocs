Function: reset
-----------------------------------

#### syntax: (reset)\
 syntax: (reset true)

In the first syntax, `reset` returns to the top level of evaluation,
switches the [trace](#trace) mode off, and switches to the MAIN
context/namespace. `reset` restores the top-level variable environment
using the saved variable environments on the stack. It also throws an
error "user reset - no error" which can be reported with user defined
error handlers. Since version 10.5.5 `reset` also interrupts command
line parameter processing.

`reset` may return memory that was claimed by newLISP to the operating
system. `reset` walks through the entire cell space, which may take a
few seconds in a heavily loaded system.

`reset` occurs automatically after an error condition.

In the second syntax, `reset` will stop the current process and start a
new clean newLISP process with the same command-line parameters. This
mode will only work when newLISP was started using its full path-name,
e.g. `/usr/bin/newlisp` instead of only `newlisp`. This mode is not
available on Win32.
