Function: base64-dec
----------------------------------------

#### syntax: (base64-dec *str*)

The BASE64 string in *str* is decoded. Note that *str* is not verified
to be a valid BASE64 string. The decoded string is returned.

    (base64-dec "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=")  â†’ "Hello World"

For encoding, use the [base64-enc](#base64-enc) function.

newLISP's BASE64 handling is derived from routines found in the Unix
[curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) utility and conforms to the RFC 4648
standard.
