Function: make-dir
--------------------------------------

#### syntax: (make-dir *str-dir-name* [*int-mode*])

Creates a directory as specified in *str-dir-name*, with the optional
access mode *int-mode*. Returns `true` or `nil` depending on the
outcome. If no access mode is specified, most Unix systems default to
`drwxr-xr-x`.

On Unix systems, the access mode specified will also be masked by the
OS's *user-mask* set by the system administrator. The *user-mask* can be
retrieved on Unix systems using the command `umask` and is usually
`0022` (octal), which masks write (and creation) permission for
non-owners of the file.

    ;; 0 (zero) in front of 750 makes it an octal number

    (make-dir "adir" 0750)  

This example creates a directory named `adir` in the current directory
with an access mode of `0750` (octal 750 = `drwxr-x---`).
