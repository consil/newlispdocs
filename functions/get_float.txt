Function: get-float
---------------------------------------

#### syntax: (get-float *int-address*)

Gets a 64-bit double float from an address specified in *int-address*.
This function is helpful when using imported shared library functions
(with `import`) that return an address pointer to a double float or a
pointer to a structure containing double floats.

    double float * foo(void)
    {
    double float * result;
    …
    *result = 123.456;
    return(result);
    }

The previous C function is compiled into a shared library.

    (import "mylib.so" "foo")
    (get-float (foo))  → 123.456

`foo` is imported and returns a pointer to a double float when called.
Note that `get-float` is unsafe when used with an incorrect address in
*int-address* and may result in the system crashing or becoming
unstable.
