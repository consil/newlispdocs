Function: write-char
----------------------------------------

#### syntax: (write-char *int-file* *int-byte1* [*int-byte2* ... ])

Writes a byte specified in *int-byte* to a file specified by the file
handle in *int-file*. The file handle is obtained from a previous `open`
operation. Each `write-char` advances the file pointer by one 8-bit
byte.

`write-char` returns the number of bytes written.

    (define (slow-file-copy from-file to-file)
        (set 'in-file (open from-file "read"))
        (set 'out-file (open to-file "write"))
        (while (set 'chr (read-char in-file))
            (write-char out-file chr))
         (close in-file)
        (close out-file)
        "finished")

Use the [print](#print) and [device](#device) functions to write larger
portions of data at a time. Note that newLISP already supplies a faster
built-in function called [copy-file](#copy-file).

See also the [read-char](#read-char) function.
