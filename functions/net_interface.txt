Function: net-interface
-------------------------------------------

#### syntax: (net-interface *str-ip-addr*)\
 syntax: (net-interface)

Sets the default local interface address to be used for network
connections. If not set then network functions will default to an
internal default address, except when overwritten by an optional
interface address given in [net-listen](#net-listen).

When no *str-ip-addr* is specified, the current default is returned. If
the `net-interface` has not been used yet to specify an IP address, the
address `0.0.0.0` is returned. This means that all network routines will
use the default address preconfigured by the underlying operating
system.

This function has only usage on multihomed servers with either multiple
network interface hardware or otherwise supplied multiple IP numbers. On
all other machines network functions will automatically select the
single network interface installed.

On error the function returns `nil` and [net-error](#net-error) can be
used to report the error.

    (net-interface "192.168.1.95")  → "192.168.1.95"
    (net-interface "localhost")     → "127.0.0.1"

An interface address can be defined as either an IP address or a name.
The return value is the address given in *str-ip-addr*
