Function: legal?
------------------------------------

#### syntax: (legal? *str*)

The token in *str* is verified as a legal newLISP symbol. Non-legal
symbols can be created using the [sym](#sym) function (e.g. symbols
containing spaces, quotes, or other characters not normally allowed).
Non-legal symbols are created frequently when using them for associative
data access:

    (symbol? (sym "one two"))  → true

    (legal? "one two")         → nil  ; contains a space

    (set (sym "one two") 123)  → 123

    (eval (sym "one two"))     → 123

The example shows that the string `"one two"` does not contain a legal
symbol although a symbol can be created from this string and treated
like a variable.
