Function: delete-file
-----------------------------------------

#### syntax: (delete-file *str-file-name*)

Deletes a file given in *str-file-name*. Returns `true` if the file was
deleted successfully.

On failure the function returns `nil`. For error information, use
[sys-error](#sys-error) when used on files. When used on URLs
[net-error](#net-error) gives more error information.

The file name can be given as a URL.

    (delete-file "junk")

    (delete-file "http://asite.com/example.html")

    (delete-file "file://aFile.txt")

The first example deletes the file `junk` in the current directory. The
second example shows how to use a URL to specify the file. In this form,
additional parameters can be given. See [delete-url](#delete-url) for
details.
