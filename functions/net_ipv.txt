Function: net-ipv
-------------------------------------

#### syntax: (net-ipv *int-version*)\
 syntax: (net-ipv)

Switches between IPv4 and IPv6 internet protocol versions. *int-version*
contains either a 4 for IPv4 or a 6 for IPv6. When no parameter is
given, `net-ipv` returns the current setting.

    (net-ipv)      → 4
    (net-ipv 6)    → 6

By default newLISP starts up in IPv4 mode. The IPv6 protocol mode can
also be specified from the commandline when starting newlisp:

    newlisp -6

Once a socket is connected with either [net-connect](#net-connect) or
listened on with [net-listen](#net-listen), the
[net-accept](#net-accept), [net-select](#net-select),
[net-send](#net-send), [net-receive](#net-receive) and
[net-receive-from](#net-receive-from) functions automatically adjust to
the address protocol used when creating the sockets. Different
connections with different IPv4/6 settings can be open at the same time.

Note, that currently [net-packet](#net-packet) does not support IPv6 and
will work in IPv4 mode regardless of settings.
