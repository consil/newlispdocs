Function: get-char
--------------------------------------

#### syntax: (get-char *int-address*)

Gets an 8-bit character from an address specified in *int-address*. This
function is useful when using imported shared library functions with
[import](#import).

    char * foo(void)
    {
    char * result;
    result = "ABCDEFG";
    return(result);
    }

Consider the above C function from a shared library, which returns a
character pointer (address to a string).

    (import "mylib.so" "foo")
    (print (get-char (foo) ))       →  65 ; ASCII "A"
    (print (get-char (+ (foo) 1)))  →  66 ; ASCII "B"

Note that it is unsafe to use the `get-char` function with an incorrect
address in *int-address*. Doing so could result in the system crashing
or becoming unstable.

[get-string](#get-string), [pack](#pack), and [unpack](#unpack)
functions.
