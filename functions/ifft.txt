Function: ifft
----------------------------------

#### syntax: (ifft *list-num*)

Calculates the inverse discrete Fourier transform on a list of complex
numbers in *list-num* using the FFT method (Fast Fourier Transform).
Each complex number is specified by its real part, followed by its
imaginary part. In case only real numbers are used, the imaginary part
is set to `0.0` (zero). When the number of elements in *list-num* is not
an integer power of 2, `ifft` increases the number of elements by
padding the list with zeroes. When complex numbers are `0` in the
imaginary part, simple numbers can be used.

    (ifft (fft '((1 0) (2 0) (3 0) (4 0)))) 
    → ((1 0) (2 0) (3 0) (4 0))

    ;; when imaginary part is 0, plain numbers work too

    (ifft (fft '(1 2 3 4))) 
    → ((1 0) (2 0) (3 0) (4 0))

The inverse operation of `ifft` is the [fft](#fft) function.
