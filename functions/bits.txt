Function: bits
----------------------------------

#### syntax: (bits *int* [*bool*])

Transforms a number in *int* to a string of 1's and 0's or a list, if
*bool* evaluates to anything not `nil`.

In string representation bits are in high to low order. In list
presentation 1's and 0's are represented as `true` and `nil` and in
order from the lowest to the highest bit. This allows direct indexing
and program control switching on the result.

    (bits 1234)      → "10011010010"

    (int (bits 1234) 0 2) → 1234

    (bits 1234 true)     → (nil true nil nil true nil true true nil nil true)

    ((bits 1234 true) 0) → nil ; indexing of the result

[int](#int) with a base of 2 is the inverse function to `bits`.
