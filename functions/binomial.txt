Function: binomial
--------------------------------------

#### syntax: (binomial *int-n* *int-k* *float-p*)

The binomial distribution function is defined as the probability for an
event to occur *int-k* times in *int-n* trials if that event has a
probability of *float-p* and all trials are independent of one another:

***binomial = pow(p, k) \* pow(1.0 - p, n - k) \* n! / (k! \* (n -
k)!)***

where *x!* is the factorial of *x* and *pow(x, y)* is *x* raised to the
power of *y*.


    (binomial 10 3 0.5)  â†’ 0.1171875

The example calculates the probability for an event with a probability
of 0.5 to occur 3 times in 10 trials. For a cumulated distribution, see
the [betai](#betai) function.
